## Usage Examples

### Basic Simulation
```bash
# Run with default settings
python run_sim.py

# Run with specific configuration
python run_sim.py --config configs/base.yaml --loops 200

# Run with different realism level
python run_sim.py --realism empirical --loops 150
```

### Process Mining Analysis
```bash
# Complete analysis with insights
python demo_complete.py

# Quick data overview
python -c "
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('outputs/match_log.csv')
print(f'Events: {len(df)}')
print(f'Actions: {df.action_type.value_counts().to_dict()}')
"
```

### Custom Configuration
```yaml
# configs/custom.yaml
pitch_width: 34.0
pitch_length: 52.0
dt: 0.066
realism_level: 'empirical'
max_ticks_without_change: 180
max_game_time: 600
```

## Architecture

### Agent System
- **PlayerAgent**: Represents individual players with role-based behavior
  - Attributes: team_id, role, position, stamina, action_weights
  - Actions: PASS, DRIBBLE, SHOOT, CLEAR, MOVE_OFFBALL
  - Decision: Îµ-greedy with xThreat maximization

- **BallAgent**: Handles ball physics and possession
  - Physics: Velocity, friction, bouncing
  - Possession: Player assignment and transfers
  - Kicking: Power, accuracy, noise modeling

- **RefAgent**: Manages match flow and timing
  - Timekeeping: Match duration, halves
  - Events: Goal detection, out-of-bounds
  - Termination: Time limits, possession changes

### Action Mechanics
```python
# Example action execution
action = player.choose_action()  # Îµ-greedy selection
if action == ActionType.PASS:
    target_x, target_y = action_planner.plan_pass(player)
    if action_validator.can_pass(player, target_x, target_y):
        ball.kick(target_x, target_y, power=10.0)
        logger.log_event(case_id, timestamp, player.unique_id, 
                        player.team_id, "PASS", target_x, target_y,
                        xthreat_delta, current_tick)
```

### Process Mining Integration
- **Event Logging**: Every action generates timestamped events
- **Case Management**: Possessions as process instances
- **xThreat Tracking**: Expected threat delta per action
- **PM4Py Export**: Native XES format for process discovery

## Data Model

### Event Log Schema
```csv
case_id,timestamp,player,team,action_type,dest_x,dest_y,xThreat_delta,tick

## Process Mining Workflows

### 1. Basic Process Discovery
```python
import pm4py
log = pm4py.read_xes('outputs/match_log.xes')
net, im, fm = pm4py.discover_petri_net_inductive(log)
pm4py.view_petri_net(net, im, fm)
```

### 2. Performance Analysis
```python
# Analyze xThreat patterns
df = pd.read_csv('outputs/match_log.csv')
threat_analysis = df.groupby('action_type')['xThreat_delta'].agg(['mean', 'std', 'count'])
```

### 3. Team Comparison
```python
# Compare team performance
team_stats = df.groupby(['team', 'action_type']).agg({
    'xThreat_delta': ['mean', 'sum'],
    'case_id': 'count'
}).round(4)
```
